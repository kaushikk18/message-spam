Since many years during

this era on this earth..

..our ancestors lived

in peace and happiness.

At that time from

the locality of Aghori..

..some Demons of the community

of Vethal captured a location..

..and placed it under their reigns.

The Demons strength

is much greater than humans.

The color of their eyes is blue.

When they are angered,

their canines get sharper and long.

The place where the Demons lived

came to be known as Country of Demons.

The Demons have captured 56 villages.

Their king lived in

a huge indifferent fort.

Without his permission even

Lord of death cannot enter it.

In the fort king lived with

his daughter Princess Yamanarani.

But the king always thought

about the welfare of his public.

There was peace and prosperity

in the entire state.

Princess Yamanarani

had many magical powers.

When she would see an innocent

and helpless person being troubled

Then her anger had no limits.

She would give punishment

to the culprit..

..worse than death

with her magical powers.

Princess married a Vethal.

She had a beautiful

daughter from this marriage.

For the princess these happy

days were no less than a dream.

That was going to break very soon.

The king appointed

Jaltarang as his Dalpati.

The moment he got this position

he started showing his true colors.

With the help of a priest..

..he had done a dangerous

black panther under his control.

It started killing

people of the village.

The clouds of tyranny and oppression..

..started spreading on

a happy and prosper state.

During this time only

one person could help him.

Our Puliveer has the strength

of killing with the power of his eyes.

Let me see whether he

is able to save you or not.

Oh God.

Now call your Puliveer.

Call him.

Why are you laughing?

Didn't you hear the sound?

The power has come to save us.

And you will die.

Puli-the savior of the villagers.

A great fighter.

He was perfect in using

all sorts of weapons.

He was a strong man that

could kill 100 enemies together.

The enemy started trembling

with fear on hearing Puli's name.

Puli was none other

than king's brother's son.

Puli left the luxuries of the

palace and lived with the villagers.

So that he could work

for their betterment.

At this time a great happiness

was about to come in Puli's life.

Her wife Pushpa was going

to become a mother soon.

If there was anyone who could

save 56 villages then it was Puli.

Mother, why are they killing our

brave people by tying them like this?

Is it their fault or that

of the kingdom?

Dear, this is because

of that new head Jaltarang.

There are total 56 villages around.

For years two prayers are

being done here.

One is Uttar prayer held at the

time of sowing.

And second is Paad prayer done

at the time of harvesting.

But after the arrival of this

devil Jaltarang..

..paad prayer never took place.

Paad prayers need to be done

day after tomorrow..

..but it will not take place, son.

It will take place, mother.

Day after tomorrow Paad prayer

will be done in Vindhyanagar.

Till then I will stay with you.

This Puliveer has not taken

birth to be popular.

But has been born to take

care of people.

The king and princess were totally

unaware of the intentions of Jaltarang.

Puli tried to tell them

the truth through a messenger.

That how Vethal army

was torturing the public.

The king and princess got

worried after this information.

Jaltarang became alert.

He started getting scared that

Puli might reveal

his truth to the king.

Immediately Jaltarang went to meet

his unkind priest Kurvadi.

He gave him a ring full of powers.

And said..

I have done magic on the hair that you

gave me of princess Yavanarani

And by doing magic and penance in the

jungle I have made ring with full powers.

By pressing the ring given by

the priest the..

..green smoke started spreading

in the air.

That smoke slowly, slowly

started moving towards the princess.

Just as a bad soul enters

someone's body and controls it.

Similarly due to that smoke the princess

came under the control of Jaltarang.

With his black panther Jaltarang

killed the husband of princess.

The princess thought

it to be a bad accident..

..and held the cheetah responsible.

Under the influence of

smoke Jaltarang jailed the king.

Now the royal palace

was under his control.

Now prayers were being done with great

pomp and show in Vindyanagar.

And then..

Puliveer..

You look just like a lion.

Not only in looks.

Don't get scared.

They are not your children but mine.

I will save them at any cost.

If you put even a step forward

then all children will be killed.

Children are beautiful than heaven

and they spread happiness.

Which hell do you want

to go after killing them?

I can do anything to keep the

rule in my hands.

Till we are alive this cannot happen.

Yes, this cannot happen.

By your presence their fear has

vanished.

And that fear can

be seen on your face.

An unkind person has many weapons

but a kind person has only one.

And that is his people.

That is it.

I am going to kill you by your weapon.

Even if a drop of blood comes out

from children's body then I shall...

If you want that no drop of blood

should come out from their body then..

You will have to drink this

poison completely.

Without even a drop spilling

and that also now.

Hey, not only these

children but even..

..if you kill all the children

of this village

We will not let our prince die.

We will not let him die.

We will not let him die..

Mother, this much love is enough.

Not only in this life but I can

die for you in every birth.

He does not have the

courage to fight with..

..me directly so that is why

he is doing all this.

Now will you show your

bravery or drink the poison.

Will you leave children if

I drink poison?

I swear.

I believe you.

Don't do like this.

You are the heir of this state.

We will give away our lives

but you will have to be alive.

Don't do like this.

Don't drink this poison.

Don't drink this.

No son, no No..

It is the duty of king to save

the last life, mother.

Don't do it prince.

It is your duty to listen to me.

For the happiness of my people

I shall accept death happily.

If you go away then who

will save this earth.

You will save. Each one of you will

love mother Earth

Then there will be no need of a king.

This earth is going to be mine and..

..you are going to get mixed

with this earth.

Jaltarang, I am a seed.

If you bury me here then another one

will be born who will finish you.

Dalpati, a son is born to the prince.

You said it right and he is born.

No, what happened?

My child.

Pushpa..

Prince!

Kill this child.

And along with people

burn the entire village.

The birds that saved the

child were actually humans.

They were cursed by priest Kurvadi.

They knew that one day Puli's

son would free them from this curse.

They kept an egg with you

and left you in the river.

The princes Yamanarani wore

the crown and became the queen.

But actually Jaltarang ruled.

On Jaltaran's request priest Kurvadi

started a Mahamritunjaya prayer.

Through Yamanarani

on every solar eclipse

He would sacrifice an unmarried

born on full moon day.

By doing this prayer

continuously for 18 years

Then she would be able

to know all black magic.

And if Jaltarang could

make relation with her

Then he would be the owner

of all black magic powers.

He will win over death

and become immortal.

And will rule the world for ages.

There was sadness all over.

Because of Jaltarang

people's happiness vanished.

At this moment a villager

by the name Vimbhunath

Was trying to get his

village out of this problem.

Once when he was washing

clothes on the shore of the river.

He heard a sound.

That child was none

other than Puli's son.

Vimbhunath took him to

the priest of the village.

This child is in trouble

from the time he was born.

Alright, feed one leaf

every day from this herb.

Do not miss a single day..

..as it will mean trouble.

Be careful.

I'm very thirsty,

please give me water.

He started talking!

He is talking.

From today, including my daughter,

now I have 3 children

The baby was named Magdhira..

..and the talking bird was named

Sura and he started to raise them.

Hey!

Father, the village fears

in the name of the Demons, isn't it?

Why has no one attempted

to face them yet, father?

You sound like a grown up man..

..else as you used

to be scared until now..

..now that you know the truth

you have many questions, isn't it?

I will tell you.

I bow to you King.

All our left over grains and money..

..is also being forcefully

taken away by your people.

We know, you have been

kept in dark about it.

Behind all the nuisance

caused to our community..

..is the hands of

your Minister Jal Tarang.

Isn't it your duty Mother

Queen to look after and support us?

I am Jal Tarang.

I only follow the orders of my Queen.

Vembunath was spared..

..so that people would

fear similar consequences..

..if they acted against the Demons.

Once when the folks of

Wadyanagar did not pay the tax..

..the Demon folks suddenly

came to the village.

Here take half of the money.

My daughter please spare Pawanmalli.

I will pay the full

taxes from now onwards.

I hit you!

I was afraid that our Pawanmalli

would get hurt so I hit you.

Padmavati!

The Demon's killed

Magdhira's elder sister.

She sacrificed her life

for her younger brother.

The head of the village Chinnavarma..

..sent Pawanmalli

for further studies..

..to the neighboring state

at her maternal uncle's house.

Count the fruits and

then keep it properly..

..you can't do one task properly!

Minister Sir,

the demons have come to the village.

Where is Magdhira?

He is the only one

that can face the demons.

Leave, leave, leave me.

Leave my legs.

Sir, Sir..

Sir, forgive us. Forgive us.

We are no good in your comparison.

You are a Demon and

we are just Humans.

If you keep a generous

heart and forgive us this time..

..Sir, then next time

we will stand in a long queue..

..and pay off all the debt.

Magdhira,

here is the debt we have to pay.

Magdhira's interference

has saved you all this time..

..because he caught

my feet and stopped me..

..but next time if you show

any smartness to not pay the tax..

..I will destroy you all.

Sir, your name? - Vidari!

Elder brother,

Vidari, forgive us Vidari we..

Say, 'Long live' brothers.

Long live Vidari.

Vidari, forgive us Vidari

Long live

Brother ate goat meat..

..and even the priest's

cooked bread and chick peas.

Brother, ate Goat meat and the

priest's cooked bread and chick peas.

Listen, just listen..

He has forgiven

us and left already, Magdhira.

He left!

Magdhira..

The entire village

is amazed by your bravery.

The one who bows down also

knows to strike when necessary.

Today you caught the legs..

..tomorrow you will catch the neck.

That is bound to happen remember.

Your blessings are necessary.

I need a small help.

Whenever someone

comes to our village..

..you ensure they reach here safely.

Tomorrow is the big worship day..

..it's also an auspicious day.

My daughter Pawanmalli..

..is returning to the village

after completing her studies.

Son, tomorrow early morning..

..can you go receive my

daughter from the river bank?

That's..

"That's my duty too", isn't

that what you wanted to say brother?

Brother Makadhira, will Pawanmalli

be light or dark skinned?

She will be green!

Just shut up and walk!

How will we recognize

Pawanmalli in so many people!

Where is my Tarak Mangal..

..she is not in the water,

not on the shore..

..may be she will

come down from the sky.

Beloved!

Wow, she is so beautiful.

Who created her?

It's me beloved, your to-be Tarika.

You are not a Tarak, you are a lotus.

Mother told me. - What did she say?

You have one moustache

below your nose..

..and one moustache above your nose.

In this whole world who else can think

of keeping 2 moustaches, beloved!

After seeing you I have become..

..crazy!

He will become bald before that.

Go away, go away from here.

Friend, I will be right back.

How's your business going on brother?

Magadheera, I like that you

are taking me on a horse carriage.

Just wait and watch, there is more.

Magadheera,

you look even more handsome..

..after growing a moustache and beard.

You haven't grown a moustache..

..does it mean you haven't changed?

I shouldn't say this..

..but you are a request from God..

..and above that this sari.

If you say more, I will kill you.

Let it be then!

Tell me,

how is everything at the village?

All is going very well.

Yesterday itself our Magdhira

caught the Demon's legs..

..and pleaded him

and saved Wadyanagar.

What, caught the legs

and saved the village?

Why did he have to tell her that!

I feel ashamed to say that I

am the daughter of Wadyanagar village.

Dorangi - Yes.

It is futile telling

her this she won't understand.

Why won't I understand!

Don't we have a brave

heart in our village?

Brother Magdhira..

..turn the horse to the

left and take a reverse..

..we will escape from that route.

Aim for the guy in

center and catch his feet..

..that's when we will be saved.

He is right,

first think of escaping from here.

That's like it!

Bravo! Way to go.

In the story of the Lion and Goat,

you are the Lion..

..you proved that, Magdhira.

Wow, he beat them

all and chased them away.

If you are so strong then

why did you hold his legs yesterday?

Even if an army of demons attack..

..I will beat them to

the punch for Pawanmalli.

But over there in the village,

everyone depends on me..

..we have to bend backwards a little.

The other name for bravery

is self-resistance..

..what can I do if someone

thinks it is cowardly.

Now, there is no

need to be ashamed of..

..being a daughter

of Wadyanagar village.

There are brave hearts there too.

Let's go.

The wait is over, Tarika.

Now we will plan our big wedding..

..and get done with

everything quickly.

Mother.. - Come dear.

I am fine, mother.

Father. - God bless you.

Mother, we faced

big trouble on our way..

..but Magdhira saved us.

We are grateful to you, son.

It is my duty.

Yes, father.

Are you going to say anything?

I cannot believe it at all..

..the demon's sent by you were

even better than the real demons.

That's amazing. - Great acting.

What a battle it was, they

were flying around from everywhere.

Magdhira,

seeing you fight and your bravery..

..Pawanmalli must have fallen

in love with you, isn't it?

She must have.

If she hasn't, we will prepare for

another round of battle with demons.

Now what is your next step.

North worship.

Hello Chief Sir how are you?

I am fine, son.

Today it's quiet cold.

Exactly.

That is why it's important

to enjoy the chill.

I did not understand.

- Nothing really.

I was wondering if I could

take your daughter to the mountain.

Are you joking? - Joke?

The weather is nice.

I want to go and play.

It was different when

you both were kids..

..now she has grown up.

Malli, will you come with me..

..we will go roam

around a little and come.

Here me out, son you leave.

Don't waste your time.

My daughter will

not cross her limits..

..and even take one step

out of the door. Do you understand?

Listen, look over there.

What's this!

She has no respect for her father.

When did I not respect father's words?

I did not even take

one step out of the door..

..I came out of the back side.

I am going, mother.

Pawanmalli

How did you recognize me yesterday?

By your eyes.

When my sister passed away..

..those same eyes shed tears for me.

There's something in these eyes,

something different.

My father is rushing

to get me married to that person.

You have been in my heart

since you went to another state..

..how can I let you

get married to someone else.

Magdhira, there is some good news.

In the last birth I must

have done some blessings.

..my marriage has been

finalized with Tarak Mangal.

How suddenly?

You are glowing to-be groom.

You will have to

keep one thing in mind..

..you will have to be standing

right in front and get me married.

We will do it in a big way.

- My honeymoon?

Don't do that in front of me, please.

Hurry up,

it's just that you are young..

..and you must have already thought

of ways .to keep your wife happy.

Share 3 tips with

your brother as well..

..so I can straight go

to Tarak and impress her happily.

You aren't going to tell me.

Then can I ask you

a straightforward question?

Alright, ask.

During the honeymoon..

During the honeymoon,

milk and fruits are necessary?

Why are you laughing, brother?

Milk and fruits are necessary..

..because you need some strength.

Do it gently, she should not get hurt.

Tarak Mangal is mine now.

My lotus flower.

I have been waiting impatiently

for this night since so many nights.

Tara.. - My beloved.

Tara.. - My beloved.

Sister, I have gate crashed

in your honeymoon how do you feel?

You are very shameless..

..how many times did I

tell you not to call her sister.

I will beat you to pieces

if I see her anywhere close to you.

Get out of here.

Sister.. - Move!

Leave! Don't show our

face till I have 3 kids.

So should I come after the fourth?

Get out! Get out!

Why do you have to get

angry about everything.!

Son-in-law, what happened?

What happened!

He entered my wedding night room.

A kid enters a wedding night room..

..and sees something he shouldn't

be seeing and gets scared..

..how am I going to

answer to his parents.

Sister, shall I go sister?

- Don't come back!

Father-in-law.. - Yes, son-in-law.

You take mother-in-law

and go towards that side.

I will take your daughter

Tarak Mangal and..

Son-in-law. - What happened?

It's just a cat..

..it isn't an elephant

that you are screaming.

It's just that if a cat goes

between your legs on wedding night..

..it signifies bad luck.
